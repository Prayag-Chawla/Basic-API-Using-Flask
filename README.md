# Basic-API-Using-Flask

I have made a very very basic API using Flask, in future I aim to make REST API and other advance projects using APIs. I have created a server, and printed user id, email, and name on the server itself. I also verified this by running the server url on Postman software, it ran succefuly, of which screenshot I have attached below.
